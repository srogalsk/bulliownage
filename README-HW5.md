"Since you are going to stop working on this app you must make sure it is ready for distribution and handoff. For distribution you must make sure you can use a build task (you may find Grunt or Gulp useful) to minify your CSS and JS and even your HTML if you like. You should also make sure that your files are bundled together into a minimum number of files. You must turn in a repo or zip file that contains both the production and development version of your app."

The report should be of enough length to cover most relevant aspects of your development, discussion of all important issues you have faced and solved (or worked around :) ). It is completely specific to your team, but I would say around 4-6 pages of normal sized and spaced text. You can include the stuff you had in README from previous homeworks. Again it should be more than a readme, but rather a complete documentation, a guide for the future developer.
