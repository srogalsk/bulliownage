ToDo
Refresh and Settings button should do something
Dropdown should filter our results based on the type of metal selected
	For example: if metal is gold, then Type should only show Gold bullion
Image button needs to either have default pictures or be able to add pics by user
Items page needs to have information gathered on the items from somehwere
	Apparently hard to find an API for this
